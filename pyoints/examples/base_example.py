"""In this example we learn the basics of point cloud processing using Pyoints.


We begin with loading the required modules.

>>> import os
>>> import numpy as np

>>> from pyoints import (
...     storage,
...     transformation,
...     IndexKD,
... )
>>> from pyoints.misc import print_rounded


Then we define input and output paths.

>>> inpath = os.path.join(
...                 os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), 'data')
>>> outpath = os.path.join(
...                 os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), 'output')


We select an input LAS point cloud.

>>> infile = os.path.join(inpath, 'forest.las')
>>> lasReader = storage.LasReader(infile)


We get the origin of the point cloud.

>>> print_rounded(lasReader.t.origin, 2)
[  364187.98  5509577.71       -1.58]
>>> print(lasReader.date.year)
2018

Then, we get the projection of the point cloud...

>>> print(lasReader.proj.proj4)
+proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs


... and the number of points.

>>> print(len(lasReader))
482981


We get the spatial extent in 3D.

>>> print_rounded(lasReader.extent, 2)
[  364187.98  5509577.71       -1.58   364194.95  5509584.71       28.78]


Now, we load the point cloud data from the disc. We receive an instance
of `GeoRecords`, which is an extension of a numpy record array.

>>> las = lasReader.load()

>>> print(las.shape)
(482981,)
>>> print(las.date.year)
2018

We get some information on the attributes of the points...

>>> print(sorted(las.dtype.descr))
[('classification', '|u1'), ('coords', '<f8', (3,)), ('intensity', '|u1')]

>>> print_rounded(las[0:10].intensity)
[216 213 214 199 214 183 198 209 200 199]

>>> print_rounded(np.unique(las.classification))
[2 5]


... and take a look at the extent in 2D and 3D.

>>> print_rounded(las.extent(2), 2)
[  364187.98  5509577.71   364194.95  5509584.71]
>>> print_rounded(las.extent(3), 2)
[  364187.98  5509577.71       -1.58   364194.95  5509584.71       28.78]


Now we take a closer look at the spatial index. We begin with selecting all
points close to the corners of the point cloud's extent.

>>> radius = 1.0
>>> corners = las.extent().corners
>>> print_rounded(corners, 1)
[[  364188.   5509577.7       -1.6]
 [  364194.9  5509577.7       -1.6]
 [  364194.9  5509584.7       -1.6]
 ..., 
 [  364194.9  5509584.7       28.8]
 [  364194.9  5509577.7       28.8]
 [  364188.   5509577.7       28.8]]

But before we select the points, we count  the number of neighbors within the
radius.

>>> count = las.indexKD().ball_count(radius, coords=corners)
>>> print_rounded(count)
[2502 1984 4027  475    0    0    0    0]


OK, now we actually select the points.

>>> n_ids = las.indexKD().ball(corners, radius)
>>> print(len(n_ids))
8


For each point we receive a list of indices. So we concatenate them to save
the resulting subset as a point cloud.

>>> n_ids = np.concatenate(n_ids).astype(int)
>>> print(len(n_ids))
8988

>>> outfile = os.path.join(outpath, 'base_ball.las')
>>> storage.writeLas(las[n_ids], outfile)


We can also select the `k` nearest neighbors.

>>> dists, n_ids = las.indexKD().knn(corners, k=2)

We receive a matrix of distances and a matrix of indices.

>>> print_rounded(dists, 2)
[[ 0.3   0.3 ]
 [ 0.02  0.04]
 [ 0.49  0.49]
 [ 0.62  0.62]
 [ 3.95  3.97]
 [ 5.71  5.73]
 [ 1.26  1.27]
 [ 1.65  1.66]]
>>> print_rounded(n_ids)
[[     6  16742]
 [ 92767  92763]
 [320695 321128]
 [206255 206239]
 [440696 440687]
 [400070 400050]
 [400369 400340]
 [365239 365240]]


Again, we save the resulting subset.

>>> n_ids = n_ids.flatten()
>>> len(n_ids)
16

>>> outfile = os.path.join(outpath, 'base_knn.las')
>>> storage.writeLas(las[n_ids], outfile)


If we need to select points in the shape of an ellipsoid, we can also create a
scaled spatial index. Doing so, each coordinate axis is scaled individually.

>>> T = transformation.s_matrix([1.5, 0.9, 0.5])
>>> indexKD = IndexKD(las.coords, T=T)


Again, we select neighboring points using the `ball` query. But here, we need
to scale the input coordinates beforehand.

>>> s_corners = T.to_local(corners)
>>> print_rounded(s_corners, 1)
[[  546282.   4958619.9       -0.8]
 [  546292.4  4958619.9       -0.8]
 [  546292.4  4958626.2       -0.8]
 ..., 
 [  546292.4  4958626.2       14.4]
 [  546292.4  4958619.9       14.4]
 [  546282.   4958619.9       14.4]]

Finally, we apply the query and save the subset.

>>> n_ids = indexKD.ball(s_corners, radius)
>>> n_ids = np.concatenate(n_ids).astype(int)
>>> print(len(n_ids))
8520

>>> outfile = os.path.join(outpath, 'base_ellipsoid.las')
>>> storage.writeLas(las[n_ids], outfile)
